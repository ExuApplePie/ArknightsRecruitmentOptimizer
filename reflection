Split the image into each of the tags using some basic pixel counting and math
then OCR each tag. This was somewhat of a headache but I got it to work by resizing the window and then screenshotting it.
Also for some reason the screensize isn't always the same. I just used math and also matching the text to the closest string.
After that, I just added a global keyboard hook so that it would always listen for the hotkey and then run the script.
