Split the image into each of the tags using some basic pixel counting and math
then OCR each tag. This was somewhat of a headache but I got it to work by resizing the window and then screenshotting it.
Also for some reason it would not work when the window was in the middle of the screen so I added some text processing.
Basically if the tag it read in contained an illegal string, just remove that part and pray it is close enough.
I think an alternative I could've done was put all the legal tags into an array and match to the closest string? But that seems more complicated than just removing
the illegal strings and pray it works.

After that, I just added a global keyboard hook so that it would always listen for the hotkey and then run the script.
